        <h2>Glendalough</h2>
     
        <p>Our first stop on this day trip was Glendalough. After roughly an hour and a half drive through the beautiful countryside, we arrived at a beautiful valley with a museum with various artifacts and models of medieval village monastery things. Then, after a short movie (in which somewhat concerning comments were made about paganism were made), we found out that this historic site was just outside in the beautiful valley. We got to explore these roughly 1000-year-old stone structures, one of which was a circular tower over 100 feet tall that was somehow in pretense condition. All of this was set in the most incredible backdrop of massive cliffs and 2 lakes. After visiting the site, we walked over to the second and larger of the 2 lakes, which was just the most incredible walk/view.

        <h2>Kilkenny</h2>
        <p>For the second half of our journey, we drove for roughly another two hours from Glendalough to Kilkenny, a beautiful tiny town just outside of Dublin. We had an hour to look around the small downtown where there was a super nice design store and market set on a perfect day. I ran over to the massive cathedral to see the crazy architecture just in time to make it to the castle for our tour. We got to go on a self-guided tour through the massive Kilkenny castle, which I loved purely for the variety of colors and styles that each lavish room had. After we saw the castle we hopped back on the bus took the ride home to Dublin and called it a day. Overall it was a fantastic day trip and my favorite day so far.
