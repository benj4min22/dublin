        <h2>Cliffs of Moher</h2>
        <p>For day 2, we got on the bus and left Galway immediately, and started the drive over to the cliffs of Moher. On the way, we got to stop at a really cool castle that was by the sea, and the weather there was just perfect; it sort of felt like a studio Ghibli movie. We eventually got to the cliffs, which were so beautiful, but I found them quite scary. It seemed like the risk of death was not insignificant there. Nonetheless, I walked a large portion of the cliffs and did my best to really take them in. After that, it was just a long drive back to Dublin.
