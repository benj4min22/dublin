    <p>Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington, was born in Dublin and spent his childhood in Trim, Co. Meath where he received his early education. He served as a member of the Corporation and later as a Member of Parliament representing Trim. Wellington had been noted for his military prowess; he famously defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo. He went on to become Prime Minister of England in 1828. A statue on a pillar in Trim erected in 1817 commemorates him. Busts in Trinity College and the National Gallery in Dublin are all dedicated to the memory of the "Iron Duke".
    
    The Wellington Testimonial has four bronze plaques cast from cannons captured at Waterloo. The plaques depict 'Civil and Religious Liberty' by John Hogan, 'Waterloo' by Thomas Farrell and the 'Indian Wars' by Joseph Robinson Kirk. The inscription reads: "Asia and Europe, saved by thee, proclaim /Invincible in war thy deathless name /Now round thy brow the civic oak we twine /That every earthly glory may be thine".

<p>On Easter Monday 1916 the Irish Citizen Army attempted to overthrow the governing British powers in Dublin, by taking control of strategically-important sites around the city.

Rebels under the command of Michael Mallin and Constance Markiewicz seized control of St Stephen's Green. Trenches were dug around the perimeter of the park, and the glasshouse was used as a First Aid station. Evidence of fighting can be found on the Fusiliers' Arch at the northwest entrance to the park, where bullet holes can still be seen to this day on the structure.
