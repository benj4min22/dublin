        <h3>First class: Remembering how to code/stopping to smell the flowers </h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>Most of the first class was filled with confusion. We learned how to apply the inspect element to our own pages, which was cool because I used that a lot when I was younger. Then, at the end of class, I struggled to use Github, but luckily, I was able to figure it out. </p>

        <p>After we finished our first real class, we were given the afternoon off to do as we please, with the only request that we take lots of pictures. I took the opportunity to run to and around Phoenix Park, which we had visited briefly the previous day. I was blown away by just how big it was and how many grass/blooming flowers there were. The highlight was definitely seeing a herd of maybe 200 deer that seemed completely unbothered by people. It was one of the coolest experiences I've had in a long time.</p>

        <h3>Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: solid day of work</h3>
        <p>
            For our class in the morning, we got a lot deeper into adding images to our HTML websites. At first, when we added the images in, they just themselves and auto-sorted into the page. We eventually were taught how to use image grids to methodically place images wherever we wanted and format them all relative to each other. Overall, I still don't think I understand image grids or inspection yet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For our afternoon class, we returned to the classroom, and we had 2 guest lecturers. One of them was a professor in gamification, and the other was a librarian that is working on rebuilding a college's library website system. We learned all about the psychology of how people interact with stuff and then it was tied into accessibility to learn the best practices behind appealing to people while still remaining accessible. I would say that I got a lot out of this lecture.

        <h3>EPIC museum </h3>
        <p>
            The only real thing of note today was visiting the EPIC museum, which was themed around the famine and the diaspora that it caused. Overall, I  didnot like the museum very much. There were no artifacts; they just had screens instead. The screens and content they did have were overwhelming and uninteresting. If we were looking at the museum from an accessibility perspective, it did pretty awful at that, too. So far it was my least favorite activity on the trip.

        <h3>Visit to the National disability authority </h3>
        <p>
            On this day, we took taxis to the “nice part of town” where the main office of the national disability authority is. They are the government agency that monitors all private and government agencies to ensure they sufficiently follow accessibility guidelines. We had a presentation with one of the lead web accessibility managers. First, we got a history lesson on how accessibility rights started in the US and how Europe followed after them, however quite different the philosophy are. Finally, in the end, we got to hear how the NDA monitors websites in Ireland to enforce accessible website practices. Altogether, it was very informative and quite cool that we got to meet, which helped us learn why we are doing what we are doing in this class.</p>

        <h3>Trip to Northern Ierland: An Unfinished Revolution</h3>
        <p>
        <p>
            I did a 90 euro day trip tour to Northern Ireland, which sounds a little expensive, but we got to see many things, and we did not have to worry about coordinating travel; all we had to do was get on the bus in the morning. The first stop was in Belfast, where we could go to the Titanic museum or a black cab city tour. I picked the cab tour because I wanted to learn more about the troubles. I was completely blown away by the tour and the city; there was a massive wall that goes down the middle of the city separating the 2 groups of people. We got to go on both sides of the wall and see how different it was with the street art condemning the actions of the other side while mourning their own losses.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the next leg of the trip, I got to briefly see the Titanic museum but I did not get the chance to actually go in. We then went an hour further north to the beautiful coast, where we saw Dunlic castle, which you could really tell was the inspiration behind the Iron Islands from Game of Thrones; however, we only had 30 minutes there, so I had to go very fast. Then, for our last stop, we went to the famous Giants Causeway. The first thing we did was eat at the restaurant that everyone and their grandma seemed to love, but I actually did not like my sandwich. Instead, I just lied and said I did (It was not very well made). We then took the walk down to the causeway, where the people I was with were taking too long, so I ditched them to look at it on my own. The rocks were quite slippery, but climbing the hexagons was definitely optional. I think I did a great job of taking pictures. Overall it was a great day, and the Belfast cab tour, I think, changed my whole view of the world and, in a way, changed my life.

        <h3>Visit to the Microsoft European Headquarters: A fancy tech building.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Originally, the plan was for us to go to some tiny museum today, but during class, the plans changed, and we were on for our much-anticipated Microsoft headquarters tour. It was a pain to get there, and we seemed to hit every red light in the city, but we eventually arrived only 6 minutes late for our tour. We saw all four floors of the massive building with some design similar to the UM Kinesiology building. Honestly, it was all pretty typical tech company-building stuff, but it was nice nonetheless. I think the actual desks and workspaces seemed like the nicest part of the building to me. After the tour, we gave a presentation about AI. It was generic, but it helped reassure me that I had picked the right career path. I am quite grateful for the opportunity to be able to see an actual workspace for a company like that and for being able to meet people that work there; however, I don't think I got an internship out fo thin air.

        <h3>Touring the Docklands
        </h3>
        <p>
            Today's activity was to go to the riverside area in Dublin and learn how Ireland has evolved over a relatively short period. We have learned all about how the world changes over time and how new things crop up, but what is unique is just how fast Ireland and Dublin specifically moved from a third-world country to a first-world country and then what struggles it faced in an aggressive initial market. What stood out to me is how many ups and downs the country faced as it saw significant success with lower taxes and received support from the EU, but it seemed like things came crashing down as fast as they were built up. The story ended off with learning about the current housing crisis in Dublin, which had a lot of parallels to America. The Docklands tour was not what I had expected, but I was pleasantly surprised.
