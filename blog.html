        <h3>First class: Remembering how to code/stopping to smell the flowers </h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>Most of the first class was filled with confusion. We learned how to apply the inspect element to our own pages, which was cool because I used that a lot when I was younger. Then, at the end of class, I struggled to use Github, but luckily, I was able to figure it out. </p>

        <p>After we finished our first real class, we were given the afternoon off to do as we please, with the only request that we take lots of pictures. I took the opportunity to run to and around Phoenix Park, which we had visited briefly the previous day. I was blown away by just how big it was and how many grass/blooming flowers there were. The highlight was definitely seeing a herd of maybe 200 deer that seemed completely unbothered by people. It was one of the coolest experiences I've had in a long time.</p>

        <h3>Guest Lecture with Dr David Williams: solid day of work</h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 9, 2024</time>
        <p>
            For our class in the morning, we got a lot deeper into adding images to our HTML websites. At first, when we added the images in, they just themselves and auto-sorted into the page. We eventually were taught how to use image grids to methodically place images wherever we wanted and format them all relative to each other. Overall, I still don't think I understand image grids or inspection yet. 
        </p>

            For our afternoon class, we returned to the classroom, and we had 2 guest lecturers. One of them was a professor in gamification, and the other was a librarian that is working on rebuilding a college's library website system. We learned all about the psychology of how people interact with stuff and then it was tied into accessibility to learn the best practices behind appealing to people while still remaining accessible. I would say that I got a lot out of this lecture.
