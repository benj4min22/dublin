        <h3>First class: Remembering ow to code </h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>Most of the first class was filled with confusion. We learned how to apply the inspect element to our own pages, which was cool because I used that a lot when I was younger. Then, at the end of class, I struggled to use Github, but luckily, I was able to figure it out.</p>

        <h3>Going on a run: stopping to smell the flowers </h3>
        <time datetime="2024-05-09">May 8, 2024</time>
        <p>After we finished our first real class, we were given the afternoon off to do as we please, with the only request that we take lots of pictures. I took the opportunity to run to and around Phoenix Park, which we had visited briefly the previous day. I was blown away by just how big it was and how many grass/blooming flowers there were. The highlight was definitely seeing a herd of maybe 200 deer that seemed completely unbothered by people. It was one of the coolest experiences I've had in a long time.</p>
